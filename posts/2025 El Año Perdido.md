# 2025 El Año Perdido

2024 was shaping up to be one of my favorite years. My boyfriend at the time and I had gone to toronto. I went camping in Pennsylvania for the first time, I went to muliple family parties. I hosted a few parties of my own. I had fixed the estranged relationship I had with my father. I don't know when things exactly went wrong but when they did they went absurdly wrong.

Between October of 2024 and March of 2025 I was submitted to a series of events that led me towards a year in a perpetual dull state. The rest of the year was spent grieving. In October of 2024 my dog muffin passed away. Her death was not only hard for me to deal but it was the ending of a chapter of my life. I, 25 at the time, had seen all remnants of my childhood gone. From the time I turned 18 in 2016 until the octobber of 2024 I had experienced multiple deaths in my family, my next door neighbor lorenzo who was like a grandfather to me. My maternal grandmother "titina", my nextdoor neigbor nelly, my cousin cecille, and now muffin. All of these deaths were hard for me. I think muffin was hardest because of the circumstances. I kept repeating in my head the first moment I saw her. She was a tiny yellow chihuahua. When I got her she was the size of a squirrel. I remember how scared she was to see me at the first time. Eventually that fear turned into sleeping between my legs, daily greeting dances, and the constant need for attention. She will always live in my heart and in my memories. I will never forget her.

In November of 2024 I witnessed the death of my country. I saw the only stateswoman this country could ever know lose to a wannabe tyrant. That set the tone for an era of hopelessness. Hopelessness about that day. Hopelessness about the weeks ahead. And for a moment wishing and hoping that I was in some kind of nightmare that would end. 

A week later my friend's brother died and I chose to delay my grieving to be strong for her. Looking back at that time, ther had to be a better way for me to have grieved. Compartmentalization was a huge mistake. In a way however the comapny our friend group offered eachother at that time also helped me. Unfortuantly I was in a mental state where going to a funeral was better than isolating myself. And even though I wish the circumanstances had been different, I do not regret spending time with her. Even if I chose to compartmentalize my own issues.

2 weeks after that I broke up with my ex boyfriend. I know thomas was trying his best. I know he was working around his limitations. Unfortantly I wanted a lot more. I had lost really a best friend. I did emphantilize and baby him a lot. But it wasn't out of a need to patronize him. I just had such a love for him that I was 

Now all of those memories of that bitter end to 2024 come back to me as oscillations. Repeating themselves and coming back. Every day I see a different angle of thse things.  

Now I live as someone who has superseded that version of myself.
